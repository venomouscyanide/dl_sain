## The third project:
 Rewrite the previous project in PyTorch and convolution networks in Colab. Your code should  classify the handwritten digits (e.g., 0,1,..,9) with accuracy of 98% or higher.  Also, you should see what highest accuracy you can get on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Try to challenge  yourself to get to the highest accuracy by using Convolution Networks, Hyperparamter tuning, Dropout, DropConnect, Residual Netowrks, etc.

## Advice:
Don’t underestimate how much materials you need to read and listen to fully do this project.  If you don’t have a good background on ML, I think you need to spend 6-7 hours per day in next 10 days to do this project and understand what you have done! Good luck! and remember to ask the question from your peers.
