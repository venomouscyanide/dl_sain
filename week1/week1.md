## Week 1
### The first project
Write a simple python code in Colab to classify the handwritten digits (e.g., 0,1,..,9) with accuracy of 95% (you are not allowed to use TensorFlow, Keras, or Pytorch). Just use standard library in Python + NumPy.

MNIST
#### Deadline
Share you code via Colab by Thursday 13th noon to everyone else, we meet on Friday 14th. The invitation for meeting will be sent to those registered for the course by replying my question above.
#### Advice
 Don't underestimate how much materials you need to read and listen to full do this project.  If you don't have a good background on ML, I think you need to spend 5-6 hours per day in next 10 days to do this project and understand what you have done! Good luck! and remember to ask the question from your peers.
